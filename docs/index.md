# Streaming Sensor Data to Rapidly Prototype Augmented Reality Apps

`tango_ros_bridge` allows you to stream sensor data from a Google Tango smartphone directly to any computer running ROS.  Streaming data in this manner allows you to program apps the utilize the rich sensor data of Tango (fisheye camera, 3D location tracking, and 3D point clouds) using any of the programming languages supported by ROS (Python and C++).  Additionally, you will be able to leverage all of the powerful features of ROS (e.g., visualization tools, debugging tools, recording tools) from the comfort of your own laptop (or other computer).

# Getting Started
`ros_tango_bridge` has two components you will need to configure: an Android app that runs on your Tango smartphone and a ROS package that should be installed on your ROS computer.

## Prerequisites

In order to use `tango_ros_streamer`, you must have the following dependencies installed.
* [ROS (Indigo or later)](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)

## Obtaining the Code

To obtain the code clone the `ros_tango_bridge` repository.  To streamline the integration of the code from the repository with ROS, you should clone the repository into your [catkin workspace](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace) `src` directory.  For instance, if your catkin workspace is installed in the typical location, you would use these commands to clone the repository.

``` bash
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/occamLab/tango_ros_bridge
```

## Building and Installing the Android App

An [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) project is included as part of the repository under the `android_code` subdirectory.  Use Android Studio to build and install the app to your Tango-equipped smartphone.

## Installing the ROS package

As long as you cloned the repository into your catkin workspace, there is nothing you have to do in order to install the ROS package.  You do, however, have to install one Python library.  The `decorator` library can be installed using `pip`.

``` bash
$ sudo pip install decorators
```

## Running tango_ros_bridge

On the machine running ROS, launch the main `tango_ros_streamer` launch file.
``` bash
$ roslaunch tango_streamer stream.launch
```

On the smartphone, open up the `ROS Streamer` app, enter the IP address of your ROS computer and click `Connect`.

To ensure that the connection has been made properly, on the computer running ROS print out the pose information from the phone.
``` bash
$ rostopic echo /tango_pose
```

If all goes well, you should see output similar to the following.
